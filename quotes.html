<p>Here is a list of my favourite quotes. Most of them are programming related.</p>
<p><span class="body">"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler"</span><br />
<em><span class="body">--Albert Einstein</span></em></p>
<p>"Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to predict the future is to invent it."<br />
<em>--Alan Kay</em></p>
<p>"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."<br />
<em>--Abelson & Sussman</em></p>
<p>"The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases."<br />
<em>--Jon Bentley & Doug McIlroy</em></p>
<p>"The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague."<br />
<em>--Edsger Dijkstra</em></p>
<p>"Simplicity is the key to brilliance."<br/>
--<em>Bruce Lee</em></p>
