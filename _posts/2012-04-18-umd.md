title: Please use UMD for your JavaScript libraries
tags: [javascript, amd, umd, requirejs]

I think all JavaScript module writers should start using [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) when defining their modules.
Yes, it's a bit messy and seemingly unnecessary boilerplate. But if you really cared about your users, then you'll do it. :)


Even if you don't like using an AMD like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), you will do your users
a big favour by using one of the UMD variants.


For example, a jQuery plugin can be defined as follows:


{% highlight javascript %}
// Uses AMD or browser globals to create a jQuery plugin.

// It does not try to register in a CommonJS environment since
// jQuery is not likely to run in those environments.
// See jqueryPluginCommonJs.js for that version.

(function (factory) {
    if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
        // AMD. Register as an anonymous module.
        define(['jquery'], factory);
    } else {
        // Browser globals
        factory(jQuery);
    }
}(function ($) {
    $.fn.jqueryPlugin = function () {};
}));
{% endhighlight %}


This is [taken](https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/jqueryPlugin.js) straight from the umdjs repo.
