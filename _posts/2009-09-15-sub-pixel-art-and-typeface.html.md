<p>I never knew favicons require such care and dedication to make them more appealing to our eyes.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://typophile.com/node/60577">post</a> on <em>miha</em>'s blog shows how YouTube's favicon can be improved by using sub-pixel rendering. There are also improvements made to a few other favicons.</p>
<p>Then there's this <a href="http://typophile.com/node/61920">post</a> by the same author that shows a work-in-progress subpixel typeface.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering">Sub-pixel rendering</a> is a technique used to increase the apparent resolution of a LCD display. Pretty neat!</p>
