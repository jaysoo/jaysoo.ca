There is a [JS Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com/004-jsj-backbone-js-with-jeremy-ashkenas/) 
that came out recently that focused on [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/). 
The cast featured Jeremy (developer for Backbone.js) and Yehuda (developer for 
[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)), and touches on some interesting points:

- Convention over configuration
- Opinionated library
- What is MVC?

Any front-end developer definitely should listen to the whole jabber. It also provides some insight 
to the current state of web development.
