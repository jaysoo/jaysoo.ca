title: Kissette.com launched
---
I'm happy to announce the launch of Kissette's website: <a href="http://kissette.com">kissette.com</a>. The design was done by Sandra (of Kissette), while I worked on the web stuff. This is the first website I've built with HTML5 in mind. The audio players on the website are fully functional on the iPhone and iPad (via the &lt;audio&gt; tag). Some notable JavaScript libraries I used:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/">Sound manager 2</a>: adds audio to to your site by using &lt;audio&gt; or Flash for fallback. No Flash interface in either case.</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/">html5shiv</a>: Force Internet Explorer to recognize HTML5 elements.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>: Adds classes to the &lt;html&gt; elements to allow you to target specific browser features in your stylesheets.</li>
</ul>
