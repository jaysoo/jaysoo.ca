<p>Congratulations to Barbara Liskov for being the receipient of the <a href="http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1108679&srt=year&year=2008&aw=140&ao=AMTURING">2008 Turing Award</a>, the first woman receipient.</p>
<p>Exerpt taken from the ACM award citation:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1108679&srt=year&year=2008&aw=140&ao=AMTURING">
<p>Barbara Liskov has led important developments in computing by creating and implementing programming languages, operating systems, and innovative systems designs that have advanced the state of the art of data abstraction, modularity, fault tolerance, persistence, and distributed computing systems.</p>
<p>The Venus operating system was an early example of principled operating system design. The CLU programming language was one of the earliest and most complete programming languages based on modules formed from abstract data types and incorporating unique intertwining of both early and late binding mechanisms. ARGUS extended many of the CLU ideas to distributed programming, and incorporated the first versions of nested transactions to maintain predictable consistencies. Other advances include solutions elegantly combining theory and pragmatics in the areas of decentralized information flow, replicated storage and caching of persistent objects, and modular upgrading of distributed systems. Her contributions have been incorporated into the practice of programming, thereby influencing many of the most important systems used today: for programming, specification, systems design, and distributed architectures.</p>
