title: Toki Underground and The Queen Vic
---
<p>&nbsp;Launched two more websites: <a href="http://tokiunderground.com/">Toki Underground</a> and <a href="http://thequeenvicdc.com/">The Queen Vic</a>. Both are restaurants on H Street in Washington D.C., and both were designed by Alexis Thornlow.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://blog.ovidiu.ch/dragdealer-js">DragDealer</a>&nbsp;for Queen Vic's <a href="http://www.thequeenvicdc.com/menus/dinner-menu/">menu section</a>, which is a JavaScript library I have known for a while but never got to really use it. Since iPhone doesn't support scroll bars in elements with <code>overflow: auto</code>, some JS solution was needed and DragDealer was ideal for that.</p>
