title: On Stores and Domain Events- Exploring Flux and React Part 1
tags: [javascript, flux]
---

There's been a lot of discussion on what Flux is, the different variations, and how the pattern can be improved upon.
I've even blogged about Flux [here](http://jaysoo.ca/2015/02/06/what-the-flux/) on this blog!

I've spent significant amount of time in the last little while researching and building applications in Flux and React, trying
to learn has much as I can from what people have done. I thought I would contribute back by presenting my own thoughts and
learnings.

Although I will be sharing examples using both Flux and React, they are actually orthogonal to each other. You could, for example, use Angular with Flux, Backbone with React, and so forth.

I will be releasing each post separately in the next week or so:

1. [Flux] On Stores and Event Sourcing
2. [React] A Tale of Two Components
3. [React] Late-Binding Through Contexts

Of course, I welcome all feedback on the subject, so please leave a comment at the end if you have one.

And without further ado, here is the first post of the series: **On Stores and Domain Events**.

## What are Stores?

- Event stream per aggregate

## Populating Store data

## Testing Stores

### Unit tests

### Smoke tests

Run through commands and make sure our stores are in the correct state.

## Final thoughts
