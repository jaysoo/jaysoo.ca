<p>This is my first attempt at a dedicated programming blog. More interesting posts are on their way, but for now here's a little info about me!</p>
<p>In my short professional career (which includes several co-op jobs when I attended the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>) I've mostly been in web development. Actually, I've been doing the whole web stuff since about mid-90s, starting with HTML, JavaScript and Perl. Just on my personal/hobby websites.</p>
<p>I've worked with many languages, but my current interests are JavaScript and Python. I am a huge fan of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, and have used it on several projects, including <a href="http://www.globecampus.ca/">GlobeCampus</a>. I expect the majority of my posts in the near-future to be on JavaScript and Python. ;)</p>
<p>Currently, I'm working as a web developer at <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/">The Globe and Mail</a>.</p>
