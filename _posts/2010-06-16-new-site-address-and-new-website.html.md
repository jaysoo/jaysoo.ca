<p>I'm using <a href="http://jaysoo.ca">jaysoo.ca</a> now. I'm not sure if it'll be the domain I primarily use, but it makes sense since it's my username for many websites (github, hacker news, etc.).</p>
<p>Also, I helped my dad launch his company's website over at <a href="http://enguda.ca">enguda.ca</a>. It's running on Python and Django on the server-side, and jQuery in browser-land.</p>
