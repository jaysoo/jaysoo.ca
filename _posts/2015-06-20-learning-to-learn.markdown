In this post, I want to present the process of learning that I have used
and continue to evolve for my personal development. I will reference
materials that have been influential in forming my views on intelligence
and achievement.

Entity hypothesis vs incremental hypothesis.

## What learning goals should I focus on?

- Problem space vs solution space.

- Breadth-first vs depth-first approach.
