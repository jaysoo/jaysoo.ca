title: Video manipulation in Firefox 3.1 using HTML 5
tags: [firefox, javascript, html5, canvas, video]

<p>Here's an cool <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Manipulating_video_using_canvas">post</a> from the Mozilla Developer Center regarding the new <code><video></video></code> in Firefox 3.1. The demo featured is a video filmed with a green screen, and the green screen is replaced with an image in real-time using JavaScript.</p>
<p>Pretty neat stuff.</p>
