title: Unix history and bang commands
tags: [unix, linux, shell, tips, history]

<p>shell Unix provides many useful tools, one of them being then <code>history</code> command.</p>
<p>To see a list of previously executed commands, execute history into your shell. You can also supply an integer argument to limit the number of commands to show.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
history 10
{% endhighlight  %}
<p>This can be piped into other commands, which can be useful for many purposes. For example, if I just finished a series of steps to get something working and wish to write a how-to entry for it, I could execute this:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
history | cut -d ' ' -f 5- # cut out only the commands
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The bash shell also provides the bang (!) command to execute the last command matching the provided command name.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo foo
foo
$ !echo
echo foo
foo
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Or you can use bang-bang (!!) to execute the last command</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo bar
bar
$ !!
echo bar
bar
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is useful when you get a permission denied error because you forgot to sudo.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ Make me a sandwich.
What? Make it yourself.
$ sudo !!
Okay.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can also print the matching command without executing it via the :p modifier. This will also copy that matching command to the end of your history.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo faz
faz
$ !!:p
echo faz
$ !!
echo faz
faz
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To substitute certain parts of a command, you can use the :s modified.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo baz
baz
$ !!:s/baz/Hello, World/
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can combine both modifiers as well, to preview a command before executing... might be a good idea if the command may cause damage.</p>
<p>Retrieving only arguments from a command can be done using the :$ :^, :n, and :* modifiers. The $ and ^ will look familiar to anyone who knows regex, they match the last and first arguments respectively. The :n modifier will match argument at position <em>n</em> (first argument being :1), and :* retrieves all arguments.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir foobar &amp;&amp; cd foobar # make temp dir
$ touch file1 file2 file3 file23 file20 # dummy files
$ ls
file1 file2 file3 file23 file20
$ ls file2* # list files match pattern
file2	file20	file23
$ rm !!:* # remove previously matched files
rm file2*$ ls
file1	file3
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can also use the :0 modifier to match the command name, but I don't really see the use in that.</p>
<p>One last thing about history. You can start an interactive search through history by press Ctrl+r (^R), which will interactively display commands matching what you are typing (in reverse history order).</p>
