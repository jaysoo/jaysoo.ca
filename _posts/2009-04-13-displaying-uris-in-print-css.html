title: Displaying URIs In Print CSS
tags: [css]
---
<p>One of the fundamental features of webpages is the ability to link resources together. However, whenever you print a page, you lose all the URI information on that page. Fortunately, there is a easy way to retain these URIs even when the page is printed on paper: CSS.</p>
<p>A lot of websites already use print CSS files, and with a few extra styles you can have the page print with the <code>href</code> attributes.</p>

	a:after {
		content: " (" attr(href) ") ";
	}

<p>This CSS will append the <code>href</code> attirbute of the <code>a</code> element to itself.  Of course, some URIs don't include the <code>http://</code>, so you might also need to add this CSS rule, which add your website's URI to the beginning of each link.</p>

	a[href^="/"]:after {
		content: " (http://www.mywebsite.com" attr(href) ") ";
	}
