      <p>In this post, I want to present information that I have collected on the topic of learning. The act of learning
is something we do everyday, and I think it is import to develop a more systematic approach in order to
maximize our efforts. I will include material from the field of cognitive science and will link the references at the end of the post.</p>

<h2 id="the-purpose-of-learning">The Purpose of Learning</h2>

<p>We programmers face many problems everyday. Some problems are technical in nature, while others could
be business problems, social problems, etc. Picture a big <em>problem space</em> that consists of all the problems
we could solve. In order to solve these problems, we perform a search through our <em>solution space</em> and try
to find good matches between problems and solutions. Sometimes we won’t find any solutions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/problem-vs-solution-space.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When a solution is missing, it is our responsibility to <em>learn</em> it. How we go about doing that is the purpose
of this post.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-right-goals">Setting the Right Goals</h2>

<p>Let’s start off by looking at two classes of learning goals we can have.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Performance goals</strong>, in which individuals are concerned with gaining favourable <em>judgments</em> of
their competence.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning goals</strong>, in which individuals are concerned with <em>increasing</em> their competence.</li>
</ol>

<p>People with <em>performance goals</em> tend to view the amount of effort exerted in learning as an index into
their ability. Exerting high amount of effort means an individual has low ability. Even more
dangerous, these individuals view failures as warning signs that they will be judged as having low
ability.</p>

<p>Compare this to people with <em>learning goals</em>, who view effort as a mean of activating ability. That is,
putting effort into something will result in you increasing your ability. These individuals also view
failures as an indication that the task will require even more effort.</p>

<p>Finally, for individuals with learning goals, exerting effort in the service of learning may bring intrinsic rewards
and pleasure. Whereas with performance goals, high effort may engender anxiety.</p>

<p>It is therefore important that we try to prioritize learning goals over performance goals. Of course, it is not
realistic to completely avoiding the latter. In these cases, it’s important to keep in mind that failures are not an
indication of personal deficiencies, but rather an sign that more effort is required. We also need to keep our original 
performance goal in mind and develop strategies to meet that goal.</p>

<h2 id="investment-in-loss">Investment in Loss</h2>

<p>There is a book I read few years back called <em>The Art of Learning</em>. In the book, author Josh Waitzkin left his
chess career after being an U.S. national champion eight times. He eventually found himself as a beginner in the competive
sport of Tai Chi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_hands">Pushing Hands</a>. The idea of pushing hands is to use
non-resistance to throw opponents off-balance. Instead of using force to fight force, your body yields to the force
and redirects it.</p>

<p>The concept may sound easy, but it is not intuitive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most challenging leaps for Push Hands students is to release the ego enough to allow themselves to
be tossed around while they learn how not to resist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a pushing hands beginner, you can either try to act strong and tough and keep resisting the force. Or you can
let go of your ego and allow yourself to be pushed around until you learn how to use more than brawn. The <em>investment
in loss</em> is about giving yourself to the learning process. Make learning your goal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact of the matter is that there will be nothing learned from any challenge in which we don’t try our hardest.
Growth comes at the point of resistance. We learn by pushing ourselves and finding what really lies at the outer reaches
of our abilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h2>

<p>Spaced repetition is a learning technique in which </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Breadth-first vs depth-first approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spaced repetition</p>
  </li>
</ul>
