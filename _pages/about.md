<h2>A little about me</h2>
<p>I graduated from the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> with a Bachelor of Mathematics (Honours Computer Science) in May 2007. I'm a programmer both on and off the job.&nbsp; Career-wise I've been mostly involved in web development, but as a hobby I do all sorts of stuff -- including image processing, data visualization, and solving problems on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>. And of course, I do web development for fun on my own time too. ;)</p>
<p>Aside from computers I also play the piano, both classical and pop music, and I love to cook.</p>

<h2>About this blog</h2>
<p>I started this blog mostly for myself. A lot of times I'll discover things that I want to keep track of so I can go back to, and a blog seems to be perfect for this. It's also a good way for me to share my ideas with fellow programmers, and hopefully hear some feedback via the comments.</p>
