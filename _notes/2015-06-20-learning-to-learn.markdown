- helpless vs mastery-oriented response
- challenges and adversity

## General conceptualization of goals

- Two classes of goals:
	- Perfomaace goals (in which individuals are concerned with gaining 
	  favorable judgments of their competence).
	- Leanring goals  (in which individuals are concerned with increasing 
	  their competence). 
- Focus on performance goals creates vulnerability to the helpless pattern.
- Pursuit of learning goals (competence enhancement) promotes 
  mastery-oriented pattern.

- Conceiving one's intelligence as fixed entity is associated with
  adopting performance goals, whereas conceiving intelligence as mallebale
  quality is associated with learning goals to develop that quality.

## Maldaptive vs adaptive patterns

- A response pattern that deters individuals from confronting obstacles
  or that prevents them from functioning effectively in the
  face of difficulty must ultimately limit their attainments. 
  
- The ability to maintain a commitment to valued
  goals through periods of difficulty must maximize attainments
  in the long run.
  
- In these studies, participants
  (late grade-school age children) who were likely to display the
  helpless or mastery-oriented patterns were identified by their
  responses to an attributional measure.3
  
- With the onset of failure, the helpless children:

    1. Began to report negative self-cognitions. They attribute failure to
       personal deficiencies.
    2. Began to express pronounced negative affect. They reported such
	   things as an aversion to the task, boredom with the problems, or
	   anxiety over their performance.
    3. More than two thirds of the helpless children (but virtually none
	   of the mastery-oriented ones) engaged in task-irrelevant verbalizations,
	   usually of diversionary or self-aggrandizing nature. Thus, instead of
	   concentrating their resources on attaining success they attempted to
	   bolster their image in other ways
	   
- Over 60% of the helpless children lapsed into ineffective strategies.
- Viewed further effort as futile, and perhaps documents their inadequate
  ability.
  
- Master-oriented children, did not begin to offer attributions for their
  failures.
- They did not think they were failing, but rather reflected on their ability.
- Unsolved problems are challenges to be mastered through effort.
- The mastery-oriented children not only believed they could surmount
  obstacles and reach a solution, but some even relished the opportunity to
  do so.
 - 80% Maintained problem solving strategies at prefailure levels.
     - Formed new hypothesis-testing strategies over four failure trials.
	 
- These patterns are well-documented in adults as well.

- Mastery-oriented children performed better with confusion condition
  compared to helpless children -- 71.9% reaching learning criterion
  vs 34.6%.

To conclude, the Diener and Dweck research suggests that
whereas helpless individuals appear to focus on their ability and
its adequacy (or inadequacy), mastery-oriented ones appear to
focus on mastery through strategy and effort; whereas helpless
individuals appear to view challenging problems as a threat to their
self-esteem, mastery-oriented ones.

 ## Goals
 
 - Helpless children might be pursuing performance goals.
     - Establish adequacy of their ability rather than gather evidence of
	   their inadequacy.
	 
- Performance goals are associated with a vulnerability to challenge
  avoidance, as well as to negative ability attributions, negative affect,
  and low persistence in the face of difficulty.
- Learning goals again were found to be associated with challenge seeking
  (despite low confidence in ability), as well as with an effort/strategy
  focus, positive affect, and high persistence under difficulty.
  
- When confidence in ability is high, performance goals can produce
  mastery-oriented behavior, and they have undoubtedly fueled many great
  achievements.
  
- High confidence may be difficult to sustain within a performance goal.

## How Goals Create Patterns


### Goals

- Those with performance goals use effort as index of ability (high effort
  means low ability).
- If you have to work hard at something, then you are not good at it.

- Those with learning goals view effort as a mean of activating ability.

### Affect

- Performance oriented experiencing failure or effort exertion warns of
  low-ability judgement.
  
- Learning oriented view failures failures that the task will require
  more effort. 
  
- Finally for individuals with learning goals, exerting effort
in the service of learning or mastery may bring intrinsic rewards,
pleasure, or pride (Deci & Ryan, 1980; Lepper, 1981). Whereas
within performance goals high effort may engender anxiety, and
high-effort progress or mastery is a mixed blessing, within a
learning goal high-effort mastery may often be precisely what is
sought. 

## Implicit Theories of Intelligence

- An incremental theory of intelligence is more consistently associated
  with adaptive motivational patterns.
  
- Binet, the inventor of the IQ test, was clearly an incremental theorist.
  He believed that not only specific skills, but also basic capacity for
  learning, were enhanced through his training procedures.
